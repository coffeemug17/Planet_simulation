# This is a simulation created of our solar system which currently displays the first four planets revolving around the sun. It was coded in Python in the Object-oriented programming style and uses the knowledge of Pygame. Actual Astronomical Units (AU) were used to compute the centrifugal forces between the planets and the sum and it was scaled to fit the screen!
